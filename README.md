# To use this code
Requirements: MATLAB R2020a or later version, video with body clearly in frame (suggested minimum 10 seconds, named input_video.mp4) 

**Step 1: Stabilize the video** 
1. Download stabilze.m, and put it into the same directory in MATLAB along with the video 
3. Open stabilize.m and run the script, wait until it finishes 

**Step 2: Run your desired algorim** 
1. Download final_tracking_alg.m and open the script in MATLAB
2. Drag your video file to the same folder the .m file is located
3. Press "run", estimates should print in the MATLAB terminal
